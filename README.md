# Introduction:
This system name is ideaBook. This is a secure web-enabled role bases system for collecting ideas for improvement from students in a large University. There are three types of users. Those are Quality Assurance Manager, who is responsible to oversee the process. A quality assurance coordinator who is responsible for managing the process for their department and the students who will submit idea for particular categories. We named our group as "Tech Army V-02". There are four members in our group, each member has a specific role in building this system. We developed this system following Agile scrum methodology and we have done it successfully. We tried to meet all the requirements and provide some extra features. I had played programmer and UI designer roles. So I handled technical and design aspects.
Evaluation of Product and process:
	# Key features of the system
ideaBook meets the all useful prerequisites as situation demand. 
# All of the features of ideaBook work effectively. All of the features of ideaBook are given bellow-
•	QA Manager can launch a new category with set closure date and final closure date.<br>
•	QA Manager can edit category information any time. But delete only if have not used this category.<br>
•	Users can give the thumbs up and thumbs down for any idea, but only one for each idea.<br>
•	Students can submit an idea and comment as anonymous, but the administration can see all information.<br>
•	Students can upload multiple files with idea as supporting documents if necessary. <br>
•	The category will be invisible the category list after expired the closure date. Students can’t post any idea in this category.<br>
•	After expiring the final closure date of the category all of those categories ideas comment sections will be hidden.<br>
 

•	Any inappropriate ideas can be investigated by the administration.<br>
•	Idea category will be disabled after the closure date for submitting a new idea, but comments can continue until a final closure date.<br>
•	The Department’s QA Coordinator get a notification email for posting a new idea from his/her responsible department.<br>

 

•	Staffs can view all statistics and exception reports.<br>
•	The idea author gets an email notification whenever a comment is submitted to any their ideas by a student.<br>


•	System administrator (QAM, QAC) can view the most popular ideas, most viewed ideas, latest ideas and comments and anonymous ideas and comments.<br>
•	The system automatically Deactivate students account after completing the academic session.<br>
•	QAC can delete or block any idea if necessary.
•	The system administrator (QAM) can deactivate any student user account if they think this account should not in this system.<br>
•	Quality assurance manager can deactivate staff (QAC) account if necessary.<br>
•	A statistical analysis report like numbers of idea each department, percentage of idea each department and number of contributors of each department are available for staffs.<br>
•	Each of the users of the system can create a conversation with anyone. <br>
•	Users can get runtime notifications for receiving messages.<br>
•	Users can follow  any idea by pressing a Follow button., also unfollow that.<br>
•	Users can see his own post, followed post from visiting timeline.<br>


# Strength of our system
	IdeaBook has some strong techniques and features that make it efficient and secured. The strangeness of ideaBook is given below:
•	The system can prevent any SQL injection.<br>
•	The system is capable to prevent brute force attack.<br>
•	ideaBook send an email to users for every login with an IP address and client system details.<br>

•	The hacker can’t run any script from outside.<br>
•	The system script not editable from outside.<br>
•	User access control process is very efficient.<br>
•	The system is capable to prevent any bot or robot attack.<br>
      

•	The system interface is responsive.<br>
 


•	This system interface will be easy to learn.<br>
•	Validation rules are set into client side & server side script because the client side script can be modified, then the server side script can catch any invalid input.<br>
•	The system has well navigation menu.<br>
•	The system database is fully normalized.<br>
•	The student can’t access admin dashboard pasting admin side URL. <br>
•	QAC & QAM can see a statistical report in graphical charts.<br>
 
Figure 8 The system provides a graphical report.<br>
•	The system provides runtime message notifications.<br>

# Weakness of the system
	There is some weakness in this system, these are given below:
•	System users can't modify their personal information except password.<br>
•	After post any idea and comment system take a refresh to show this.<br>

# Further Development:
This yearbook system is working perfectly as a requirement. But system development is  a continuous process  where required update old technology to new technology.  Work  to protect system from new threats. Some issues which can be take a place for further development.<br>
•	Using AJAX form post ideas and comments.<br>
•	The system will be able to provide live notification to users.<br>
•	The password recovery feature will be added to this system.<br>
# Methodology Used:
There are so many software development methodologies. Agile is one of them.  Agile software development is a group of software development methodologies. Scrum is a subset of Agile methodology. In this software development, we used agile scrum methodology. It's enables collaboration of teamwork.
We divide our tasks between team members. We played many roles like System Architect and Analyst, Database Designer, UI Designer, Programmer and Tester for developing this system successfully. We make group meeting for discussion completed works and set next work.
# Evaluation of Team:
	This web based system developed by four members where everyone played different roles. We had developed it successful because of our hard work. At the start of this development process we assigned a member as a system architect and analyst, one for database design, one for design UI and programming and one for system testing.
System architect and analyst done the hard work to find out functional and non functional requirements. The database designer worked to make a fully normalized ERD for minimize data redundancy. After completing every sprint as a programmer, I send developed part of QA/ Accepticance Tester to test this sprint to ensure it developed as required. I want to say without team members' collaboration and individual works of team members we can't do it successfully.
Team members’ efforts can be evaluated by following some criteria.
 

# Self Evaluation:
Own Efforts
In system development team I played UI designer and Programmer role.But i have to focus on other members work because of I was the team leader of this group. At first we work together to understand this system requirements. I also collaborate with database administrator in finding out better solutions to make a perfect ERD for this system. I worked to make a responsive user interface which will easy to learn to the users. I hope the user can understand this system UI at first look. I have used HTML5 for creating UI structure, Bootstrap as CSS framework to make it responsive, JQuery and JavaScript for field validation and run some function in client side. After completing development process tester start the system testing process to ensure that system is working perfectly and found some bugs and I fixed it. The system analyst confirmed that this system met the all user’s requirements and work properly.

# Lessons Learnt:
This assignment was a group assignment so I have to work with a team for completing this assignment. At first I learned how to work with a team and collaborate with team members. I know most of the project done by team work in real life working field. So it was a great opportunity to know how it’s done. I also learned some new techniques by developing this system like Google chart, Google recaptcha and like and unlike post using PHP and JavaScript and how to work following the agile scrum methodology.
 
# Conclusion:
This ideaBook is a sub-system of University portal or University management system. This system gets some important data from the main system like users’ information. This sub-system is just for gathering students’ idea about some selected topics. University staffs’ can observe students’ activities and manage students posts’ and comments’. We meet all requirements to make it successful. 
At the end, I want to say thanks to all of my team members. I am really happy to work with them. We enjoyed some fantastic moments while doing this assignment. We worked like as friends. At last I want to say i learnt some important things while developing this system. This knowledge will be helpful in my future work.
